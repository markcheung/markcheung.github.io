Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon Universty (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/) and a member of [Center for Neural Basis of Cognition](http://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/). I am advised by [Professor Jos√© M. F. Moura](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~moura/). Before joining CMU, I received my B.S. in Computer Engineering and minors in Applied Mathematics and Physics from the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/).

My research interests are in [Geometric Deep Learning](http://geometricdeeplearning.com/), i.e., applying deep learning techniques to solve problems in non-Euclidean domains such as Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis and COVID-19 drug discovery. 


In my free time, I enjoy meditating, reading, journaling, running, coding, and teaching.
